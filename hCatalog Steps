                                                HCatalog
HCatalog opens up the hive metadata to other mapreduce tools.
HCatalog is not thread safe.

HCatLoader :
HCatLoader is used with Pig scripts to read data from HCatalog-managed tables.
If the table is partitioned, you can indicate which partitions to scan by immediately following the load statement with a partition filter statement 
Usage
HCatLoader is accessed via a Pig load statement.  
Using Pig 0.14+
A = LOAD 'tablename' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();

Here we load a hive table test to pig.Start pig shell using below command:
1.	pig -useHCatalog
2.	B = LOAD 'default.test' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader()
3.	dump B;

HCatStorer : 
HCatStorer is used with Pig scripts to write data to HCatalog-managed tables.

Pre-requisite:  Hive table should exist in hive and its schema should match the pig data that we are going to store  in hive.

Take care:  We have to take care of data types before going to perform this operation.
For eg; If data type of name in pig is default i:e; bytearray and we are trying to store it in hive table having column data type string, then it throws error message  and this operation will fail.
So, we have to make data type  of column (name) as chararry , then only it will perform successfully.

File content :
 
data1 = load '/user/root/neeraj/pig/sample.txt' using PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray,loc:chararray,desg:chararray,cmp:chararray);
projected1 = FOREACH data1 GENERATE name;

STORE projected1 INTO  'default.hcatalog' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();

In hive ,data is loaded in hcatalog table :
